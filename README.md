# product-spam-cheaker-using-ML-and-django-web-framwrk
this is a spam product's review checker project
I cover some of the topics.
1.) if the username or gmail id use product name then he/she can be spamer.
2.) if the review contain 4 or more time product name the review are count as spam. you can also set it by yourself it is dynamic i set as 4.
3.) on one product same user can only give at most 1 time review.
4.) if the content are similar to another user i use ML algoritham for cheaking. 
i am showing the user who maybe spamer in a txt file so you manually delete the use as your choice

i use a kind of OTP system in my project i generate random integer and sending it on users gmail for authentication .
